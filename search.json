They contain all contents as reproducible code.\nNo recordings are made available. It’s all in the tutorials.\nThe number of students is limited to 25.\nThis course follows a hybrid class setup: input lectures, flipped classroom, and individual work on a (partly) self-guided project.\nYou will work on your own laptops, bring them to class. If this poses a limitation to your participation, please me (B.S.) know.\nTo get you set up, we’ll support you with installing all the necessary software on our laptops. But please do get started with installations and setup before our first session, following this:\n\n\nPlease install essential software needed for this course and check it is running. We will offer support in class, for those that encounter problems. Essential software is (1) R and RStudio, follow this, (2) git, follow this. Note that additional software for spatial analysis (NetCDF, gdal) is not required for AGDS I, i.e. the corresponding sections can be skipped (https://geco-bern.github.io/agds_book/getting_started.html#other-libraries-and-applications).",

    "text": "1.2 Report requirements\n\n1.2.1 What is part of the report?\nThroughout this book, you will find two kinds of exercises:\n\nExercises for which we provide solutions. These are NOT part of the final report and solutions are provided for self-study.\nExercises in sections called “Report Exercise”, which are part of your Final Report. Report Exercises in the form of executable code, generating documents with text and visualisations, will be graded. Report Exercises are:\n\nChapter 4 (Tidy data)\nChapter 5 (Air quality data visualisation)\nChapter 8 (Collaborating with git)\nChapter 9 (Stepwise regression)\nChapter 10 (KNN)\nChapter 11 (Flux modelling)\n\n\nThe data to solve all these exercises is accessible here.\n\n\n1.2.2 How do I hand in the report?\nYou will send us a link to your GitHub account by email (benjamin.stocker an der unibe.ch) that holds the three repositories (directories) containing your code:\n\nOut of the six report exercises, solve five to.\nYour report repository that holds your report as five .html files that is created from the respective five .Rmd files (one for each Report Exercise, see above).\nTwo repositories from the exercise in Chapter 8 (Collaborating with git):\n\nYour original repository that your partner’s cloned repository where you accepted a pull request.\nYour forked repository from your partner on which you opened a pull request.\n“Hand in” the “report” by pointing us to the URL of your repositories by 09.06.2024 at 8.00 CET.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 How do we grade the report?\nFor each Report Exercise you can obtain a maximum of 12 points. The final grade is the average across the number of points across Report Exercises (capped at 6, of course).\nThe grading will consider:\n\nThe code for each Report Exercise needs to be reproducible (3 P).\nGood coding practice (legibility of code, workspace organisation, proper code management) (3 P).\nQuality of visualisations (3 P).\nInterpretations (3 P).\n\nNote that we consider the commit history of your repository to ensure ownership and plausibility of your code contributions. This is to make sure that you cannot copy a repository from someone else and submit it under your name.\nImportant: Reproducibility is key and and we expect that after completing this course, you are able to conduct reproducible workflows! You can ensure that your report is reproducible by letting a colleague or yourself from re-cloning code from GitHub and run your code. This gets you the first 3 P per Report Exercise.",

    "section": "1.3 FAQ",
    "text": "1.3 FAQ\nCan Report Exercises be done as partner or group work?\nNo. Each (registered) student hands in their Report Exercise individually. We will check whether submitted Report Exercises have exact duplicates. Note that there is usually no right or wrong way to solve the Report Exercises. The process is important and for our assessment, we will consider the complete implementation of the workflow, the code, the visualisation, and interpretation rather than the exact solution. Do it yourself - it’s your opportunity to practice and gain confidence in mastering the data science workflow.\nCan I use AI for creating the Report Exercises?\nThe use of AI is permitted as a aid. However, you are responsible for all contents. AI often fails with details that could make your work unreproducible or generate wrong or unintended results. AI generally generates generic statements. In assessing your Report Exercises, we put a strong focus on these points, your interpretation of the results, and the written and visual communication. Reliance on outputs generated by an AI implies a high risk of failing on these grounds, resulting in poor grades and failure of the course. If we see that your Report Exercises look like a copy of an output of an AI, we apply a very strict grading. This course (and studying at a University in genreal) is your opportunity to learn. Make the best of it and prove us that you’re not replaceable by an AI. It would be sad and a waste of your and our time.",
